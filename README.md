    library(rgdal)

    ## Loading required package: sp

    ## The legacy packages maptools, rgdal, and rgeos, underpinning the sp package,
    ## which was just loaded, will retire in October 2023.
    ## Please refer to R-spatial evolution reports for details, especially
    ## https://r-spatial.org/r/2023/05/15/evolution4.html.
    ## It may be desirable to make the sf package available;
    ## package maintainers should consider adding sf to Suggests:.
    ## The sp package is now running under evolution status 2
    ##      (status 2 uses the sf package in place of rgdal)

    ## Please note that rgdal will be retired during October 2023,
    ## plan transition to sf/stars/terra functions using GDAL and PROJ
    ## at your earliest convenience.
    ## See https://r-spatial.org/r/2023/05/15/evolution4.html and https://github.com/r-spatial/evolution
